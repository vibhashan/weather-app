</p> 

# üî• Getting Started
1. Download or clone the repository using "git clone https://github.com/vibhashan/weather-app.git"
2. Navigate to "weather-app/application" and run the "MyWeatherApp.py" file to open the GUI interface.

# üò¢ Limitations
The application uses a free API account from AccuWeather APIs website. So, there is only a limited no.of API requests per day.
However you can simply create a free API account from "https://developer.accuweather.com/" and paste the account key in the following places :
- Line no 44 --> api_url_location = "http://dataservice.accuweather.com/locations/v1/cities/search?apikey=<your_api_key>=" + entry_value
- Line no 58 --> api_url_weather = "http://dataservice.accuweather.com/currentconditions/v1/" + location_key +"?apikey=<your_api_key>&details=true"

<p> Play around with the application and modify it as you need to be familiar with Tkinter GUI and API usage with Python. </p>
<p> Feel free to shary any suggestions as well üëç </p>
